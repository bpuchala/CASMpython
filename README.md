The CASM Python packages
========================

The `casm-python` Python packages provide a Python interface to the CASM libraries, implement wrappers to fitting methods and DFT software, and provide other tools for plotting and analysis.

This version of `casm-python` is compatible with version 1.X of [CASM](https://prisms-center.github.io/CASMcode_docs/).
